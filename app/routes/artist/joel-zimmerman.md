# Artist: {attributes.meta.title}
Best known as Deadmau5, though we have seen him operate under other aliases, namely Testpilot, BSOD

## My History with his music
I started listening to this dude around 2010, and got hooked on introduction. The songs I remember sticking out from that time are Strobe, & I remember.

# BSOD
Is it Blue Screen Of Death, or Better Sounding On Drugs? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

BSOD is Joel & Steve Duda. If you've ever produced music in a DAW, you've likely heard of the VST called [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum). Steve Duda's [xferrecords](https://xferrecords.com/) is the one responsible for the development of Serum.
